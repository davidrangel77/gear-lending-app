Gear Grow
=========

An app for photographers to list their current equipment available for lending and a way to contact other photographers to request that equipment to be loaned.

Photographers would also include a general location (by zip code) to facilitate finding the closest available equipment to the person searching.

Stretch goals would be to allow the upload of photos of equipment, a ratings and review system of current users, and possibly the ability to sell online.

Desired Outcome
===============

- A gear loaning app for photographers.
- Photographers that only need specialty equipment once in a while and do not need to buy it outright.
- By providing a list of current equipment and contacts, they will be able to network with other photographers who have chosen to participate and be more successful through mutually sharing of equipment.
- "Wildly successful" looks like a trusted system of lenders and borrowers who have furthered their individual success by using the app to extend their current skills or equipment limitations.
- There is, of course, always the posibility of dishonesty or theft with a newtworking system. Hopefully proper research by the parties involved will keep this to a minimum and the stretch goal of a ratings/review system will also aid in this.
- Most photographers use social networking or make calls to others they already know to lend/borrow gear. This can get cumbersome with so much noise that something dedicated to just this purpose would be easier to consult.  

MVP
===

- Provide a form to enter users current equipment.
- Translate that into a readable list for someone searching.
- Provide a way to put users in contact with each other.
- Allow users to update their equipment lists and contact info.
- Provide general location maps to show location of users by zip code.
